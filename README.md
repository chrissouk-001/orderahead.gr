## Project Overview

**OrderAhead** is an innovative web application designed to enhance the experience at the Atsoglou Schools Gymnasium canteen. Developed by the school's team as part of an entrepreneurship competition, under the guidance of Mr. Dimitris Liofis, MSc, this application aims to provide a fast, user-friendly, and environmentally conscious solution for students ordering from the canteen.

The primary goal is to streamline the ordering process, reduce waiting times, and promote environmental awareness among students.

## Features

The application includes the following key features:

1.  **Login & Registration:**
    *   Users can sign up or log in using their email address and password.
    *   Option for quick authentication via Google Account.

2.  **Product Catalog:**
    *   Displays a clear list of available canteen products with their respective prices.
    *   Allows students to easily browse and select items for their order.

3.  **Order Summary & Checkout:**
    *   Shows the total cost of the selected items before finalizing the order.
    *   Includes an option to request a plastic bag, encouraging users to consider environmental impact (and potentially bring their own bags).

4.  **Queue Management / Order Priority:**
    *   Displays the user's position in the queue, indicating when their order will be ready for pickup.
    *   Helps manage expectations and reduces crowding at the canteen counter.

5.  **Admin Communication:**
    *   Provides a communication channel for users to contact the canteen manager directly with questions or report issues.
